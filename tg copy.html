                    <h2>Qualitative Research</h2>
                    <p>In order to help conduct this study, I first created a proto persona of what I thought the typical user would be like. From there, I created a list of about 20 questions I thought would be relevant in discovering what is important to users while planning a trip and figuring out what issues they currently have.</p>
                    <p>With these questions, I interviewed 5 people between the ages of 25 to 65 years of age. I wanted to get different age groups as it helped give perspectives on who was impacted most by the pandemic. I also looked for different family dynamics since someone single with no kids would have a different value system than someone who is married or who has a kid. Another characteristic I looked for was if they were adventurous (this is for a travel company so people who like going out and traveling have more knowledge on the topic), were they and an extrovert or introvert (I believed I wanted both types as both might have had different values or pain points while traveling).</p>

                    <p class="bullet">Travelers do not like when things do not have a way out, are dirty or when they are in loud crowded places. They also do not like how expensive everything has become.</p>

                <h2>User Insight</h2>
                <p>Daisy, <strong>a single mother</strong> who always wants to be there for her friends and family, needs to <strong>feel more confident and secure prior to and during her trip</strong> because <strong>it's important to make sure the trip is fun for everyone and that everyone back home knows where she is and how to reach her if an emergency happens.</strong></p>
                <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
                <p>TravelGlass was designed to ease travelers ability to plan and take a trip. I have observed that most applications are not offering ways to work together and share current travel itineraries causing co-travelers to have out-of-sync plans, and causing friends and family to not have a way to reach travelers when urgent situations happen. How might we improve TravelGlass so that our customers are successful based on an increase in member engagement and location check ins, as well as an increase in return visits to the TravelGlass app?</p>
